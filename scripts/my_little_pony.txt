Pinkie Pie: [humming]
Applejack: What's goin' on, Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie: I had a notion this fridge full of potion needed cleaning.
[doorbell rings]
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] That must be my new cupcake toppings! B.R.B.!
[zip!]
[clatter]
[splash]
[shimmer]
Applejack: Hey, Twilight!
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs]
Applejack: Whatcha doin'?
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, nothing. Certainly not avoiding any specific pet in particular.
Applejack: Who?
Twilight Sparkle: So you've heard.
Twilight Sparkle: [voiceover] Owlowiscious and I got into a fight, and now we're not talking.
Applejack: You want to talk about it... with me?
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, look! Cookies! And not talking about my problems! [chomps]
Applejack: Hold up now. What if you—? [gags]
Twilight Sparkle: See?
Applejack: [gulps]
Twilight Sparkle: Tastes soooo gooooo— [yelps]
[whoosh!]
[shimmer]
Twilight Sparkle: Yaaaah! Phew!
Applejack: Aah! Oof!
Twilight Sparkle: Goodness gracious, where are we?
Applejack: We're trapped in the potion bottle! [grunts]
Twilight Sparkle: We're trapped in the potion bottle!
Applejack: [groans]
Twilight Sparkle: I don't know how this happened, but I seem to have escaped my problems and I get to hang out with one of my best friends? This is perfect!
Applejack: Uh, it's anythin' but perfect. It's imperfect! Worse, it's non-perfect! I have claustrophobia! [to fourth wall] It means I hate bein' in confined spaces. You know, like potion bottles? One of these doors must lead back out to the real world!
[doors opening and closing]
Applejack: [whimpering] It's just a process of elimination! [groans] We're trapped!
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, fiddlesticks.
Pinkie Pie: Twilight? Applejack? Where the fridge are they? Not in the cupboard. Huh. Not in the ceiling. They certainly couldn't be in here.
Applejack: We're in here! Help us! Hey, Twi! Help a pony out! Shout with me!
Twilight Sparkle: [unenthused] Help us. Pleeeease.
Rarity: Pinkie-poo-pancake, did you lose something in that potion bottle?
Pinkie Pie: Um... [gasps] I think Twilight and Applejack are somehow stuck in here!
Rarity: Good heavens! How will we ever get them out?
Pinkie Pie: Magic has trapped them, so we need to go to the potion source. We're coming ova, Potion Nova!
[zip!]
Twilight Sparkle and Applejack: [yelling]
Pinkie Pie: [panting]
Applejack: I reckon I'm gettin'— [gags]— potion motion sickness.
Twilight Sparkle: It's not so bad. It's like we're on a fun hayride.
Pinkie Pie: Potion Nova, we need your help! Twilight and Applejack are trapped inside this potion bottle!
Potion Nova: Oh. [sniffs] Ah. How about that? What you're gonna need is a super strong antidote potion. An antido-tion!
Rarity: Ooh!
Pinkie Pie: Ooh!
Rarity: Wow!
[liquid pouring]
[poof!]
Pinkie Pie and Rarity: [gasp]
[pop]
[liquid pouring]
Pinkie Pie: Here comes Potion Nova's antidote!
Applejack: Huh? We're saved! Whoa!
Applejack: Yee-haw! I'm free!
Pinkie Pie: Wait. Where's Twilight?
Potion Nova: Hmm. That should've done the trick. Unless...
Twilight Sparkle: [grunting] Must... stay... bottled! Whoo-hoo! [grunts]
Potion Nova: Twilight's desire to stay inside is strong enough to overpower the potion.
Pinkie Pie: Applejack, do you have any idea what her reason could be?
Applejack: I do. And I'm goin' back in.
Pinkie Pie and Rarity: [gasp]
Applejack: [chomps]
[whoosh!]
Applejack: Whoa! Ugh!
Twilight Sparkle: Huh? Why are you back? I thought you were afraid of being trapped.
Applejack: I am! I'm terrified! But you're my friend, and whether you know it or not, you need me right now.
Twilight Sparkle: No, I don't. I'm fine being trapped. I'm not bottling up my problems. In fact, I left them outside the bottle and bottled up myself!
Applejack: It's hard, but I confronted my problem head-on. And it felt great! I don't know what you and Owlowiscious fought about. I betcha it doesn't even matter. What matters is that you two are friends. Like you and I are friends. And—
Twilight Sparkle: And friends can solve any problem together.
Applejack: [chuckles] You're darn tootin' they can!
Twilight Sparkle: I'm ready to go now.
Twilight Sparkle and Applejack: [slurp]
Twilight Sparkle: Thank you.
Twilight Sparkle and Applejack: [yell]
Applejack: [grunts]
Twilight Sparkle: [grunts]
Potion Nova: Bit of a bottle episode you had, huh?
Twilight Sparkle: Hello there, Potion Nova! Nope. Too casual. Helloooo, Miss Nova! Psyched for my first day as your potion-prentice! Hmm. I don't know how she feels about puns. Maybe... Reporting for duty, potion master! Yeah. That'll work. Let's do this thing.
[door jiggles]
Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm... [grunting, sighs, yelps] Phew!
[stomach rumbles]
Twilight Sparkle: [groans] Butterflies in your tum? Okay. Let's do this thing.
Potion Nova: [snoring]
Twilight Sparkle: [whispering] Excuse me. Potion Nova? Reporting for duty, potion master?
Potion Nova: [snoring]
[squeak]
Potion Nova: [yells]
[boing]
[thud]
Potion Nova: Oh. [laughs] You're here early.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, I'm just excited to be your apprentice. And a little nervous. But mostly excited! [giggles]
Potion Nova: Well, it's time to get started.
[zip!]
Potion Nova: Welcome to my "Pon Appetit" test kitchen!
Twilight Sparkle: She does like puns!
[bubbling]
Potion Nova: Here we have a stew simmering.
Twilight Sparkle: Magical.
Potion Nova: Oh, and this bread is rising.
Twilight Sparkle: Truly amazing.
Potion Nova: They have nothing to do with magic, but, you know, they're fun.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, pffft! Of course! [giggles] Now this must be a super magical artifact!
Potion Nova: That's a can opener.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh! Yes! Just a silly joke! Of course I know it's a can opener! [laughs nervously]
[clatter]
Twilight Sparkle: Aah!
Potion Nova: All right. You doing okay, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: Fine! Just fine! Perfect! Never better! [under breath] This is not going as planned. Got to get these nerves under control.
Potion Nova: Let's get started with some basic potion-making.
[liquid pouring]
[boom!]
Potion Nova: [giggles]
[shaking]
[liquid pouring]
[crack!]
[fizzle]
[mole squeaking]
Potion Nova: I think this might be a good time to take five.
Twilight Sparkle: [groans]
[shatter!]
Potion Nova: Seems like you're having a hard time today. Is something wrong?
Twilight Sparkle: No! I'm fine! Let's keep making potions! Practice makes passable! I mean potion! I mean perfect!
Potion Nova: Twi! How are you really feeling?
Twilight Sparkle: Well... [quickly] I was just so nervous on my first day and wanted to impress you! But I keep making stupid mistakes and now I can't stop, even though I knoooow I'm smarter than this and you're probably gonna think that I'm dumb and bad at potions forever! I'VE RUINED MAGIC!
[beat]
Twilight Sparkle: Whoa. I didn't even know I was feeling all that.
Potion Nova: No wonder you shattered into a million pieces. You've got to take it easy on yourself and let go of those nerves and frustration.
[zip!]
Potion Nova: How about putting all that emotion into the potion rather than bottling it up inside? You've got to put your essence into it. That's when the potion's done. That we can bottle.
Twilight Sparkle: I think I can try that.
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs] I! AM SO! FRUSTRATED! RIGHT NOW!
[drip]
[splash]
[bubbling]
Potion Nova: See? Letting your frustration out is working!
[bubbling]
[zoom!]
Twilight Sparkle: How in Equestria did that happen? [whimpering] I added my real emotions!
Potion Nova: That's just potions, baby. You put in real, honest feelings, and magic still does whatever it wants. It's unpredictable. Just like us.
Twilight Sparkle: Ah. Do you think it's done?
[fizzling]
Twilight Sparkle and Potion Nova: Aah!
Potion Nova: We'll just give it a minute to settle.
Twilight Sparkle: [sighs]
Potion Nova: Great work, Twilight. I can tell you're really putting everything you got into these potions.
Twilight Sparkle: It's just such an honor to learn from the master.
Potion Nova: Oh, shucks, it's nothing!
Twilight Sparkle: No, really. That's why I was so nervous to make a great first impression.
Potion Nova: Are you kidding me? I've never had an apprentice as smart as you.
Twilight Sparkle: Aw, you've got to be pulling my hoof! You are so smart! The way you sneak in to stock the fridge...
[poof!]
Twilight Sparkle: Genius!
[beeping]
Potion Nova: Oh! That's the bread.
[zip!]
Potion Nova: [sniffs]
Twilight Sparkle: And you're an amazing cook! Is there anything this pony can't do?! Oof!
Potion Nova: Dance. I'm awful. Four left hooves. [grunting]
Twilight Sparkle and Potion Nova: [laugh]
Twilight Sparkle: You are a bad dancer!
Potion Nova: [laughs] I really, really am!
Twilight Sparkle and Potion Nova: [laughing]
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Just smell the morning air, Gummy. [deep sniff]
Gummy: [sniffs]
Pinkie Pie: So peaceful. So serene. It's like nothing bad in the whole world could ever—
[door opens]
Pinkie Pie: Aah!
[door closes]
Pinkie Pie: If this is another croissant caper, don't think you'll out-muscle me again! I know your tricks!
Rarity: [sighs]
Pinkie Pie: Oh, Rarity!
Rarity: Pinkie! Help! Something horrid has happened!
Pinkie Pie: Who did what?! Let me at' em! LET ME AT 'EM!
Rarity: It's almost too awful to say.
[crash!]
[door closes]
[poof!]
Rarity: [sighs] Ponyville's primary pony of propriety, Fancy Pants, has asked me to go for a stroll in the park!
Pinkie Pie: Um, and this is bad because... you don't want to go?
Rarity: Worse! I do want to go!
Pinkie Pie: Oh! That is awful! Wait. Why is that awful?
Rarity: "Why?", she asks. Why?! [laughs] Here's why.
[squeak]
[whoosh]
[shatter]
Rarity: [narrating] Yesterday, I was only slightly flaunting my new headband while putting a subtle fine touch on my garden, when suddenly...
Fancy Pants: Ah! My mirror!
Rarity: Fancy Pants!
Fancy Pants: Oh, how will I ever find such another lovely face to—? [gasps]
[romantic music]
Rarity: Oh! Didn't see you there. I was just casually having some potion my friend Pinkie gave me. [laughs nervously] Uh, would you like a sip?
Fancy Pants: No. I would love one!
Rarity: [gasps]
Fancy Pants: Would you like to go for a stroll in the park with me tomorrow eve?
Rarity: No. I would love to!
Fancy Pants: Ah! Then I'll see you tomorrow night!
[shatter]
Rarity: Ugh!
Fancy Pants: Oh, it seems your endearing clumsiness has resulted in a bad omen.
Rarity: Bad omen?
Fancy Pants: Well, you know what they say. Bad things happen in threes. Hopefully, our stroll won't be bad thing number three, eh? [laughs]
Rarity: [forced laughter] Yes! Terribly funny! How truly horrific! All right, Rarity. One bad thing happened. Nothing to worry about. [laughs nervously] Now, a second bad thing were to happen, and I'd really have to— Whoa! Oof!
[pounding]
Pinkie Pie: Oh. [laughs] Okay.
Rarity: My headband got covered in potion, Pinkie Pie. Now it won't stop revealing deep, dark truths to me.
Pinkie Pie: Huh. Wow.
Inner Pinkie Pie: [clears throat] Pinkie Pie. Sprinkles cannot fix every problem.
Pinkie Pie: [screams]
Pinkie Pie: That was horrible!
Rarity: So, you can see why bad thing number three absolutely must happen before my rendezvous with Fancy Pants.
Pinkie Pie: Wait, what?
Rarity: If it happens before the rendezvous, it won't happen at the rendezvous.
Pinkie Pie: That logic seems a little extreme.
[loud banging]
Rarity: Ooooh! This is it!
[crash!]
Fluttershy: Door was jammed. [giggles]
Rarity: [growls]
Fluttershy: [gasps] So cute!
Fluttershy: Huh?
Inner Fluttershy: You speak softly, yet you carry within you the most wondrous and terrifying force of all.
Rarity: Well? Was it bad?
Fluttershy: No. Nothing I didn't already know.
Gummy: [croaks]
Pinkie Pie: Let's just store this in the pantry for now, huh?
[zip!]
Rainbow Dash: Oh. You go for it.
Twilight Sparkle: No, you.
Rarity: Please don't fight! What's that? Your friendship is totally destroyed? Over such a silly misunderstanding? I never thought such a bad thing could happen! Ah, well. What can you do?
Rainbow Dash: Uh, Rarity, we're not in a fight.
[chomp]
Rarity: [screams]
Applejack: What's tuggin' your tail, Rarity?
Rarity: Bad things happen in threes. And darling, I'm on strike three.
[hiss]
Applejack: Don't you think it's just a bit of superstition? There's no logical reason that... Okay. She's walkin' away.
Rarity: That's it! This calls for more drastic action! Sabotage!
Rarity: [to herself] You impress me yet again, Rarity, you saucy sassy girl with a mane that won't quit. [to herself] Oh, so sweet. Thank you.
Applejack: Yikes.
Pinkie Pie: Souffle week of the Royal Jelly Juggernaut is notoriously difficult. But with this recipe, I know I can pull it off.
Rainbow Dash: Noice! Huh? Mm.
Rarity: [deep, gravelly voice] Must make the bad thing happen!
Pinkie Pie: [reading incoherently]
Rarity: [deep, gravelly voice] If Pinkie Pie's recipe were to suddenly disappear... that would be a bad thing. [normal voice] [gasps] But I can't take Pinkie's recipe. She needs it to compete. [deep, gravelly voice] Not until next weekend. You can get it back to her by then. She will never be the wiser. Plus, you can make it up to her later. [normal voice] Hmm. All right. You do make a good point. [deep, gravelly voice] That was... easier than I expected. [normal voice] [gasps] Ah! So it's come to this! Come at me with your worst!
Gummy: [growls]
Rarity: [yells] Take this!
[thud]
[zip!]
Rarity: Hah!
Gummy: [croaking]
Rarity: [laughs, gasps] Ugh! [grunting] So... strong! Sweet victory! [yelling] Ugh. Huh? Not like this! [wails]
Rarity: [wails] Okay, too late. I'm here. Ominous, sure, but her eyeshadow's stunning! Bravo!
Inner Rarity: Rarity, bad thing number three will not happen at the park.
Rarity: Really? Then it was all worth it.
Inner Rarity: Because it has already happened. You are trapped here with me.
[clang!]
Rarity: [gasps]
Inner Rarity: Bad things do not happen in threes, but you sealed your own fate by focusing on the negative rather than living in the present.
Rarity: Okay, yes. Profound. Whatever. But seeing as I've already learned my lesson now, can't I still go to the park?
Inner Rarity: No. [laughs] While mere seconds have passed for you and I, the outside world has aged eons! [laughs]
Rarity: [screams]
Rarity: [screams]
[door opens]
Rarity: [hyperventilates]
Applejack: [gasps]
Inner Rarity: W-W-W-W-Wait. So I lied about this one thing. But nopony ever hangs out with me here! Oh. [scoffs] Where's my phone?
Rarity: Oh, Applejack! Twilight! And even young Pinkie! You're all here! How long was I gone? A week? A century?! Oh, what a foolish filly I have been. I suppose Fancy Pants has strolled on with another pony. Good. He deserves to be happy!
Twilight Sparkle: Uh, Rarity? You were gone for thirty-five seconds.
Fancy Pants: Oh, Rarity! Stroll time! Trot-trot!
Twilight Sparkle: "Trot-trot"?
Pinkie Pie: See? He's here!
Rarity: B-B-But—!
[zip!]
Rarity: But bad thing number three!
Pinkie Pie: You can't control it. Just go with the flow.
Rarity: You sure it's just a silly superstition?
Twilight Sparkle: One can never be completely sure— [muffled]
Applejack: Yup-solutely! You've been through bad things before. Whatever happens now, you can handle it.
Rarity: You're right! I have been prepared for the worst. Why not hope for the best?
Rarity: What a lovely sunset. It reminds me of the—
Fancy Pants: I've seen lovelier.
Rarity: Oh. Oh, well, uh, changing the subject—
Fancy Pants: Right. Back to what I want to talk about – me. Earlier today, I made the best point, immediately followed by the best joke. So I laughed and laughed until everypony left. And that's when I realized the most talented pony I ever met... was me.
Rarity: Wow. I was so nervous about going walkies with you that I didn't realize... I don't like you.
Fancy Pants: Uhhhh, excuse me?
Rarity: Bad thing number three! It's you!
Fancy Pants: Ohhhh, no-no-no, impossible. You see, I never come in third place. [laughs nervously, clears throat] As I was saying...
[zip!]
Pinkie Pie: "Sprinkles can't fix everything." [scoffs] Yeah, right!
Rarity: To be quite frank, the most enjoyable part of the whole thing was freaking out beforehand! [laughs]
[beat]
Rarity: Because I did it with all of you.
Pinkie Pie: Well, I'm glad you were able to stay in the moment, decide you weren't having fun, and go with the flow by hightailing it out of there.
Rarity: And I'm glad I didn't steal your souffle recipe, jeopardizing your performance and our friendship. [laughs]
Pinkie Pie: What?
Rarity: Nothing! Love you!
Mane Six: Awwwww!
Twilight Sparkle: [panting]
Pinkie Pie: Just one sugar-frosted maple ice cream cereal souffle cupcake. And you're lucky. It's my last cupcake. Dolores is kaput!
[electrical sounds]
[thud]
[flames roar]
Pinkie Pie: Oh, my dear oven Dolores! And yeah, I named her Dr. Dolores Q. Baker. That's what you do when you love something so much. You give it a name and a Ph.D.! Without Dolores, I'm not a baker! And if I'm not a baker... then who even am I?
[door opens]
Twilight Sparkle: [panting] Sorry about Dolores, Pinkie, but... could you maybe help a pony out?
Applejack and Fluttershy: [gasp]
Pinkie Pie: [whimpers]
Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, and Fluttershy: [grunting]
Fluttershy: Ooh, it's heavy. Whoa. What's in the box? Wait! Isn't today when you're gonna build a machine to earn your Trail Trotters Engineering Badge?
Twilight Sparkle: [grunts] Indeed it is. Where should we put the box? Pinkie!
Pinkie Pie: [blows nose, whimpers] What? Oh. Yeah. I have a corner set aside as your workstation.
Applejack: [grunts] Why, you could even call this the Sugarcube Corner... Corner!
Pinkie Pie: You could.
Fluttershy: So, what's the first step?
[zip!]
Fluttershy: Instructions, right? You should always read the instructions before building something. [giggles]
Twilight Sparkle: Right you are, my young apprentice. But this will be no sweat at all, for I am the Master of Instructions! [imitates fanfare]
[beat]
Twilight Sparkle: [strained fanfare]
Rarity: I prefer a red carpet, but this'll do.
[cameras clicking]
Fluttershy: Careful! Don't walk on the instructions. Twilight needs them to build her machine to get her badge.
Twilight Sparkle: Yes, but the truth is these instructions are very confusing. I can't even tell what I'm building in the first place. What are these diagrams supposed to be?
Fluttershy: This looks like you're supposed to throw the box into the air?
Rainbow Dash: Uh, this looks like a pony playing buckball on a mountain. Or are they in a valley?
Applejack: Are you supposed to add water? 'Cause, uh, that sure looks like water.
Twilight Sparkle: And where are all these arrows pointing?
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Looks like some parts are missing.
Twilight Sparkle: I can't even figure out step one...! How am I gonna do all NINETY-EIGHT STEPS?! [shatters]
Applejack: [to fourth wall] It was then that Twilight Sparkle got very anxious and worked up.
Pinkie Pie: I'd offer you one of my special super-duper sweet-and-silly pick-me-up cupcakes. But I just ate my last one, and... [sighs]
Rarity: Darling, I'm not sure the pick-me-up is working.
Twilight Sparkle: I guess today is a total bust. I'm sorry.
Fluttershy: You don't need to apologize to us. You deserve to be a Trail Trotter.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm not the Master of Instructions. Or anything else. And I won't be getting my Engineering Badge.
Fluttershy: We know this feels like an overwhelming problem. But that doesn't mean a solution's impossible.
Applejack: Yeah! Don't be so glum, chum!
Fluttershy: You're the Master of Instructions! They're not the master of you, right? So why don't you fix them?
Mane Six sans Twilight Sparkle: [cheer]
Rainbow Dash: Yoink! I've been looking for that.
[zip!]
[electrical buzzing]
Rest of Mane Six: [laugh]
Twilight Sparkle: I've been doing this all wrong. I won't just fix the instructions. I'm gonna improve them!
Applejack and Fluttershy: [laugh]
Twilight Sparkle: Whoo-hoo! I'm gonna need an assistant!
Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: Hmm...
Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack: Huh?
Fluttershy: Do it, Pinkie. Do it for the Trail Trotters.
Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Applejack: [cheer]
Rainbow Dash: [grunting]
Twilight Sparkle: Uh...
[clatter!]
Rest of Mane Six: [cheering]
[cranking]
[drilling]
Applejack: [to fourth wall] And so, Twilight Sparkle used her ingenuity to build her own machine.
[hammering]
[drilling]
Twilight Sparkle: It's done.
Rarity: What is it?
Fluttershy: It's... a new oven for Pinkie Pie!
Twilight Sparkle: With a few extra bells and whistles.
[bells and whistles]
Pinkie Pie: This is the best gift a pony could ever get! [giggles]
[pop!]
[fizzle]
Pinkie Pie: [squeals]
Rainbow Dash: So? What's the new oven's name? [chomps]
Pinkie Pie: I think I'll call her... Dame Dulce de Leche!
Rarity: I told myself I wouldn't cry! [crying]
Fluttershy: A new oven and an Engineering Badge. Not a bad way to spend the day. Wouldn't you say, Twilight?
Twilight Sparkle: [muffled] Mmmm! Yeah, right! [gulps] It's the best! [chomps]
Rest of Mane Six: [laugh]
[whirring]
Gummy: [chomps, burps]
Pinkie Pie: Aah!
Fluttershy: [inhales, sighs] Smell what I smell?
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] You're right. Too much baking powder.
Fluttershy: No, not that. I smell an awesome Trail Trotters hike on the horizon.
[zip!]
Fluttershy: That horizon!
Applejack: Uh, Fluttershy? You reckon we should be climbin' Mt. Volcanope?
Twilight Sparkle: [whimpers] What if it erupts while we're up there? That'd be—
[door opens]
Discord: Perfect!
[thunder]
[poof]
Discord: But too bad that won't happen. That there magic volcano's been dormant for years. That's why they call it Mt. VolcaNOPE. [chomps]
Fluttershy: We Trail Trotters are hiking up Mt. Volcanope. You should join the troop and tag along.
Rarity: [gasps]
Pinkie Pie: No!
Applejack: [to fourth wall] Things tend to get a little messy when Discord "tags along".
Discord: Uh... let me think about that.
[beat]
Discord: No.
Applejack: Awww, that's a shame.
Fluttershy: You suuuuure? It'll be fuuuuun. And by fun, I mean very chaotic. And we'll be facing our fears and putting ourselves in mortal peril!
Discord: You talk a good game, Fluttershy, but my answer remains the same. I choose not to join, associate, or... pledge loyalty to any such... troop.
Mane Six sans Fluttershy: Whew!
Discord: [slurps]
Pinkie Pie: You gonna choose to pay for those?
Discord: Hey, look over there!
[poof]
Pinkie Pie: [groans]
Fluttershy: [sighs] I wish Discord were here.
Rainbow Dash: Why? He's not a Trail Trotter. He's a walking disaster.
Fluttershy: But he's my walking disaster.
Twilight Sparkle: Sometimes I worry about the friends you choose.
Fluttershy: Everypony deserves to share in the fun of being a Trail Trotter.
Rarity: That mischievous miscreant didn't seem all that interested. You can lead a draconequus, but you can't make it take a drink.
Pinkie Pie: [giggles, squeals] I can see Sugarcube Corner from here!
Applejack: This is what it's all about.
Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash: [sigh, "Whoa"]
Fluttershy: Just a little chaos.
Twilight Sparkle: Fluttershy?
Fluttershy: Enough to get Discord to join in on the fun! [grunts]
[splash]
[rumbling]
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Pinkie Pie: [screams]
Applejack: [narrating] Meanwhile, back at Sugarcube Corner...
Spike: What it'll be?
Discord: I've already decided. I'm not hiking up Mt. Volcanope.
Spike: Uh, I mean what kind of cupcake?
Discord: I wonder what sorts of boring chaos they're up to. No! I stand by my decision!
Spike: Cool, cool. Uh, speaking of decisions, what cupcake?
Discord: Hmm? Oh, hey! Look over there!
[poof]
[rumbling]
Twilight Sparkle: It's erupting!
Mane Six: [screaming]
Fluttershy: Stay calm, everypony! Remember your Trail Trotter training! When in danger, seek safety!
Mane Six: [scream]
Fluttershy: Okay, maybe this is the teensiest bit too much chaos, fear-facing, and mortal peril.
Discord: Well, this has turned out to be a perfectly boring day. [sighs] Wha? That looks like it's coming from Mt. Volcanope! And that must mean Fluttershy's in danger! Danger plus chaos equals perfect! Math. [snaps fingers]
[poof]
Mane Six: [whimpering] Huh?
Fluttershy: Discord! A little help, please!
Discord: I suppose. Why not?
Mane Six: Whoa...!
[crackling]
Rainbow Dash: You saved the day!
Mane Six: [cheer]
Fluttershy: I always knew you were a Trail Trotter at heart.
Discord: No, I'm not. I do not trot.
Fluttershy: You know what? You're right. I wanted you to be a Trail Trotter when you're really... a Solo Scout!
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Discord: Solo?
[poof]
Discord: Hmm. [snaps fingers] I like the sound of that. [slurps] Go on. Tell me, tell me!
Fluttershy: Solo Scouts are a troop of one. They rely on nopony but themselves. But, oh, you chose not to join, so forget I said anything.
Discord: Too late! I'm in! I am a Solo Scout! And I'm off to do what we Solo Scouts do best! Solo, so long! Hey, look over there!
[poof]
Mane Six: [laugh]
Pinkie Pie: Great idea to make up the Solo Scouts. That's perfect for Discord!
Rainbow Dash: Crazy that somepony could just make up a troop on the spot like that.
Mane Six sans Fluttershy: [nervous laugh]
Fluttershy: It's important to listen to your friends when they tell you something. It was wrong of me to force Discord to do something he didn't want to do. But he really would make a great Scout. [giggles]
[poof]
Discord: Uh... a certain Solo Scout can't remember how he got up the mountain, and now he can't get back down. Can he be a... temporary Trail Trotter?
Mane Six sans Fluttershy: [groan]
Fluttershy: [giggles]
Rainbow Dash: [vocalizing] Aw, yeah... [screams]
Smallfry: That race was amazing, Rainbow Dash! How do you do it?!
Rainbow Dash: Aw, thanks, little buddy! It's nothing but a little hard work, natural talent, and all-consuming desire to be the best me I can be.
Smallfry: Wow...
Rainbow Dash: But I don't do it for the trophies. I do it for the fans.
[squeak]
Smallfry: [muffled] So cool.
[zip!]
[vroom!]
Rainbow Dash: [sighs]
Twilight Sparkle: It's not quite level...
Rainbow Dash: My buddies! What's up?
Pinkie Pie: Oh! Rainbow Dash! I'm glad you're here! Everypony, give it up for Sugarcube Corner's... [echoing] Employee of the Month!
Rainbow Dash: But I don't even work here.
Pinkie Pie: You're that good. Plus, I'm working on my next humble pie recipe for the next Royal Jelly Juggernaut taping.
Rainbow Dash: Thanks! You know, of all the things I'm good at, my favorite is being friends with all of you!
Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, Rarity, and Applejack: Awwww!
[bell rings]
Pinkie Pie: ORDER UP!
[smash!]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Dishwater Slog: Ohhhh, so you're the Rainbow Dash. I've heard you're the best of the best.
[knock, knock]
[smash!]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Dishwater Slog: But are you the best at being the worst?
Rainbow Dash: Uh... what?
Dishwater Slog: I am Dishwater Slog. And I hereby challenge you to a fail-off! When it comes to being the worst, you've got nothing on me.
Mane Six sans Rainbow Dash: [laugh]
Rainbow Dash: That makes no sense.
Pinkie Pie: It's nonsensical!
Rainbow Dash: Why would I want to be the worst?
Pinkie Pie: She wouldn't!
Dishwater Slog: [laughs] Guess you're afraid of a wittle friendly competitioooon...
[scream]
Rainbow Dash: OH, NO, HE DID NOT! I'll show you my worst, all right! You'll rue the day you ever challenged Rainbow Dash! The brash! The crash! The... mustache.
Dishwater Slog: Huh. Pretty good at rhyming, I see. Definitely better than... myself. [laughs] See? I lost the rhyming round. Which means I won the losing round.
Rainbow Dash: Wait, whaaaat?
Dishwater Slog: Whoever loses the most in the next twenty-four hours wins. We'll compete in three categories, okay? Athleticism, creativity, and yup, emotions. Think you can handle that, winner? And by that, I mean... [echoing] looooseeerrr.
Rainbow Dash: Ha! Sit back and watch, everypony, as the best does her worst!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps]
Applejack: Hmmm... Rainbow Dash, now why would you try to be worse than you are? About the worst she's ever been is when she forgot to give me back the book I lent her.
Rainbow Dash: I can't say no to a friendly competition!
[zip!]
[crash!]
Pinkie Pie: Uh, shouldn't you be rushing out, too?
Dishwater Slog: Nah. This is kinda my whole thing. I don't try. I'm the best in the game at not trying.
Rainbow Dash: [straining] So... heavy...!
[crunch!]
Rest of Mane Six: [cheer]
Rainbow Dash: Oh! I'm so strong!
Rarity: Failing isn't quite your style.
Dishwater Slog: [straining] Nice try, Rainbow Dash. But you'll never amount to nothing.
[wind whistles]
[can clatters]
Rest of Mane Six: Huh?
Rainbow Dash: [growls]
Pinkie Pie: Here, Rainbow Dash! This cake was a failed experiment, so why don't you take a whack at failing to decorate it?
Rainbow Dash: It would be an honor to turn this into a creative failure, Pinkie.
[icing splattering]
Dishwater Slog: Ooh, impressive!
Rainbow Dash: No, it's not! It's terrible!
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] Wow! Perfect randomness! It's... It's beautiful! Uh, sorry. But you have to admit it looks good.
Rainbow Dash: [sighs]
Dishwater Slog: Voilà! May I present Sugarcube Corner's Worst Customer of the Month – me!
Rainbow Dash: I have never seen anything worse.
Pinkie Pie: [crying] My picture!
[door opens]
Rarity: Hello, hello, everypony! Rainbow, how's—? [shrieks] IT'S HORRID! [faints]
Dishwater Slog: [sighs] Another job poorly done. Keep it up, champ.
Rainbow Dash: Okay. Now you're making me mad.
Dishwater Slog: Ah-ah-ah. Keep expressing your emotions so healthily, and you'll lose the emotional failure round.
[honk!]
Rainbow Dash: [growls]
Rarity: There you are, my fiery friend. With my flair for le dramatique, I will be your inspired director!
Dishwater Slog: Hm. Now this I gotta see. Now, let me explain it so you can understand. The key to being an emotional failure is complete suppression of your feelings!
Rainbow Dash: You don't need to explain it to—!
Rarity: Rainbow Dash, don't take the bait.
Rainbow Dash: [sighs] Right. Game face, on!
Rarity: Cue Fluttershy!
Fluttershy: [crying] Could I please have a tiny little hug?
Rainbow Dash: Nah, I'm good.
Fluttershy: [gasps] Rejection! Noice!
Rarity: Cue Applejack! Bring the rage!
Applejack: Okay, Rainbow Dash, get mad at me! Flying is overrated! There are too many colors in the rainbow! You still haven't returned my book! Whoa. Got real there for a second.
Pinkie Pie: She is doing it!
Smallfry: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! [grunts] Aah!
[thud]
Smallfry: [crying]
Rainbow Dash: You okay, little dude?
Smallfry: Y-Yeah.
Rainbow Dash: [growls] What is the matter with you?! Don't you feel bad about being so... bad?!
Dishwater Slog: [yawns] Not really.
[boom!]
Fluttershy: [echoing] You ought to be ashamed of yourself making others feel small all the time! How can you take pride in being so... so... mediocre?!
Dishwater Slog: Easily.
Rainbow Dash: If you're such a big failure, then why are you succeeding at being such a jerk?
Rest of Mane Six: [agreeing and cheering]
Dishwater Slog: I, uh... H-Hey! Okay, that doesn't count!
Rainbow Dash: Well, I say it does. You were a champion-level jerk when you painted over Pinkie's portrait! And yet again when you broke Pinkie's sundae glass! Twice! Which means... we're tied!
Dishwater Slog: Fine. If that's how you wanna play it, then we'll just have to have a tie-breaker!
Rainbow Dash and Dishwater Slog: Loser take all!
Dishwater Slog: At sunset... we race.
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Rainbow Dash: [gulps]
Rainbow Dash: A race?! How am I gonna lose that?!
Twilight Sparkle: You don't have to do this, Rainbow Dash.
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! You're the best, and we love that about you!
Rainbow Dash: I know, but... ever since I was a filly, I could never back down from a challenge. And nothing's challenged me like this in a long time.
Pinkie Pie: Okay, but purposefully acting worse than you are?
Rainbow Dash: There must be a way! [gasps] Maybe a potion will make me worse! [gulping]
[laser sound]
Rest of Mane Six: [cheer]
Rainbow Dash: [groans] Nope. Still awesome.
Rainbow Dash: It's time. [straining] You're gonna win soooo easily!
Dishwater Slog: Yeah, right. You're so fast, you're gonna break the sound barrier.
Rarity: On your mark... get set...
Rainbow Dash: [growls]
Rarity: GOOOOOOOO!
[zip!]
[vroom!]
Pinkie Pie: She's losing! She's really losing! Huh. Doesn't feel great to say.
Applejack: This just ain't the Rainbow Dash we know and love.
Twilight Sparkle: Look! The final leg of the race!
Smallfry: Go, Rainbow Dash! Beat that meanie!
Rainbow Dash: Okay, yeah, enough of this! I'm a winner! And winners gonna... WIIIIIIIN!
[vroom!]
Rest of Mane Six: [cheering]
Dishwater Slog: [laughs] Knew you couldn't do it. My condolences.
Rainbow Dash: Thank you. Good game.
Dishwater Slog: W-Wait. What'd you just say?
Rainbow Dash: I said good game. Because that's the nice thing to do when you clobber an opponent.
Dishwater Slog: But... but... the competition! Don't you wanna beat me at my own game?
Rainbow Dash: Nah. I'm good at being me. Awesome, awesome me.
Rest of Mane Six: [laugh]
Dishwater Slog: B-B-But you're not playing by my rules! [groans] I hope you're happy!
Rainbow Dash: I am!
Rarity: Oh, darling, you're the absolute worst!
Rainbow Dash: Uh... actually, I won. Not to brag.
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, but you're the worst at being the worst!
Rainbow Dash: Okay, now that's a title I can get behind. Plus, I don't do it to live up to anypony else's standards. I do it for the fans! Oh! By the way, Applejack, here's your book back. Loved the symbolism!
Applejack: You really are the best.
Twilight Sparkle: Ooh! I've been meaning to read that one!
Dishwater Slog: I've already read it. Let me spoil the ending.
Twilight Sparkle: Thanks for letting me test the new critter-sighting app on your tablet, Fluttershy. Your cloud data should be here any moment.
[thud]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Cloud security is such a fluffy gig.
[click]
[beeping]
Twilight Sparkle: Okay, installation complete.
Fluttershy: Great! With this, I'll earn the Rare Animal Sighting Badge in no time!
Pinkie Pie: What kind of animal are you after? The world's slowest cheetah?
Rest of Mane Six: [sounds of awe]
Pinkie Pie: A pouchless kangaroo?
Rest of Mane Six: Awww...
Fluttershy: Oh, those are common compared to the one I'm after. Bighoof!
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Twilight Sparkle: I'm freaking out!
Rainbow Dash: You're kidding!
Rarity: Heavens, no!
[tea kettle whistling]
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Applejack: I've heard a few pony tales about Bighoof. [sips] Stories say it's a huge, territorial creature with big antlers. And if it catches you there, it'll transform you into a Bighoof yourself!
Rest of Mane Six: Uh... [screams]
Twilight Sparkle: Hmmm. Looking it up on Marepedia. And according to the "scaryravioli" website, everything Applejack says is true.
Fluttershy: But they also say that it has a great singing voice.
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, yeah?
[beeping]
Twilight Sparkle: This is the only known recording. Listen.
[low, dissonant groaning]
Mane Six: [whimper]
Fluttershy: So majestic.
Rarity: Majestic, that is, until it captures you! Leaving nothing but its giant, ghastly hoofprints!
Twilight Sparkle: Are you sure about this, Fluttershy? It might not want to be found.
Fluttershy: What's the worst that could happen?
Pinkie Pie: Uh, it pony-naps us and traps us in the forest and makes us listen to its lonely song forever?! It's new-age elevator music!
Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, and Rarity: [scream]
Rainbow Dash: [screams] Sounds like an adventure to me!
Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe we're doing this.
Rainbow Dash: It's not like anypony's gonna get hurt. And look how happy Fluttershy is.
Fluttershy: Everypony, keep an eye out!
[zip!]
[bushes rustle]
Fluttershy: [gasps] Hmm. [screams]
[crows cawing]
Fluttershy: Phew.
Rarity: [gasps] I see her! She's breathtaking! Oh, wait, that's me. Well, I-I stand by my opinion. Anypony see anything?
[zip!]
Rainbow Dash: Huh?
[wind whistles]
Applejack: [gulps]
[thud]
Rainbow Dash and Applejack: [scream]
Rainbow Dash: See? Nothing to be afraid of, Applejack.
Applejack: Doesn't mean we shouldn't be careful.
Twilight Sparkle: Hey, did you see where Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie went?
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, they're right over there.
Rarity: Oh, no! They've been hoof-napped by Bighoof!
Twilight Sparkle: Let's not jump to conclusions. There's a perfectly logical explanation for— [gasps] Hoofprints!
Applejack: [gulps] M-Maybe they... just got lost?
Rainbow Dash: [whimpers] L-Let's see where these tracks go.
Twilight Sparkle: What if they have been taken?! And now they're trapped in the woods forever?!
Rarity: Darling, is it me... or have all the animals disappeared?
Twilight Sparkle: I think we might have to call in some experts.
Rarity: What if we can't find them again?
Rainbow Dash: W-We just need to keep our wits about us.
[howling]
Applejack and Rainbow Dash: [gasp]
[bushes rustle]
[thunder]
Rarity, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle: [scream]
Rarity: Bighoof!
Rainbow Dash: [growls]
[howling]
Applejack: Don't go!
Rainbow Dash: I have to! If I don't come back, tell the world my story!
Rarity, Applejack, and Twilight Sparkle: [gasp]
Rainbow Dash: [yells]
[slam!]
Fluttershy: [grunting]
Rainbow Dash: [groans]
Fluttershy: [grunting] Ugh!
Pinkie Pie: Ugh!
Fluttershy: [groans]
Rainbow Dash: Ah! It's even worse than I thought! Oh. Fluttershy? We thought you were Bighoof.
Fluttershy: Sorry. I was just trying to help Pinkie Pie get unstuck from this tree.
Twilight Sparkle: And how did Pinkie Pie get stuck in a tree?
Pinkie Pie: I don't want to talk about it. There was a balloon, a stick... It all happened so fast!
Fluttershy: Sorry we scared you guys.
Applejack: [chuckles] Don't be. We're just happy you're both safe.
Twilight Sparkle: So, Bighoof didn't take you?
Fluttershy: No. [sighs] Guess I'm not getting my Rare Sighting Badge today.
Twilight Sparkle: Aww. Maybe next time.
Fluttershy: It's okay. We still got to go for a fun hike and... [gasps] take a selfie!
[camera clicks]
Mane Six: [gasp, scream]
Rainbow Dash: It's going long!
[zoom!]
Owlowiscious: [squawks]
Rainbow Dash: [sighs, laughs] All the time in the world.
Pinkie Pie: [panting] Rainbow Dash! Oh, thank hoofness I found you!
Rainbow Dash: Uh-oh. Is something wrong, Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie: I am in dire need of help... throwing a party – the Trail Trotters' Trail Mixer – for Fluttershy.
Rainbow Dash: But aren't we just pretending to be a Trail Trotters troop?
Pinkie Pie: Yup. But she thinks we're supposed to throw a party to attract new ponies to join. So now we have to pretend to do that by actually doing it. And fast!
Rainbow Dash: More like "in a dash"! You know, 'cause I'm so fast that I can control time? So fast that even I—
Pinkie Pie: No time! Rarity's finishing up the decorations, and Applejack's gathering butterflies in the orchard for... well, you'll see! And Twi has a delivery for you to make!
Rainbow Dash: Chillax. I'll head right over to Twilight's.
[beeping]
Rainbow Dash: Ooh. Uhhhh, what now? A new Wonderbolt game is dropping today?! [deep breath]
[beeping]
[owl hoots]
Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Top score! Wait. When did it become dark? Oh, no. I was supposed to deliver that thingamabob to what's-her-face!
[zoom!]
Twilight Sparkle: [whimpering]
[doors open]
Twilight Sparkle: Where have you been?! The party is in an hour, and Rarity still needs the Replitron 5000 to duplicate her decorations!
Rainbow Dash: I'll get it there in no time.
Twilight Sparkle: Just be very careful. This is a really powerful device.
Rainbow Dash: Got it. Powerful device.
[zoom!]
Twilight Sparkle: [groans]
[door opens]
Rainbow Dash: Waiting for me?
Rarity: Darling... this is my "waiting for you" face! [squeak] Device, please.
Rainbow Dash: One decorator duplicator coming up.
[shooting sounds]
Applejack: Whoa.
Rarity: Magnifique!
[pounding on door]
Fluttershy: [muffled] Is this a push or a pull?
Applejack: [gasps] Fluttershy's here! There aren't enough butterflies!
Rarity: And the decor still needs to be hung! Oh, that's it! The party's ruined!
Rainbow Dash: Not... just... yet!
[rapid clicking]
[shooting sounds]
Rarity and Applejack: [scream]
[shooting sounds]
[electricity fizzling]
[boom!]
Rainbow Dash: Whoa! What's happening?! [screams, grunts]
[electronic music]
Rainbow Dash: Rarity? Applejack? Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie Hologram: Welcome to Monarchville.
Rainbow Dash: [screams]
Pinkie Pie Hologram: Home of the original Sugarcube Corner. All hail the butterflies.
Rainbow Dash: Wait. I'm not in Ponyville anymore? Where am I? Some sort of dystopian future?
Pinkie Pie Hologram: Exactly. After the disastrous party – renamed the "Party of Disaster" – all parties were banned.
Rainbow Dash: [laughs] Okay. Very funny joke.
Pinkie Pie Hologram: I am not programmed to joke. That fateful day, monarch butterflies were duplicated so much that they blotted out the sky.
Rainbow Dash: You mean... this was my fault? Tank! You're here!
Tank: [through voice box] Yes.
Rainbow Dash: And you talk?!
Tank: [through voice box] I have been awaiting your return, Rainbow Dash. It was foretold by Twilight Sparkle.
Rainbow Dash: Listen, buddy. I've got to find my way back to fix this. I've got to find a way out of here!
Tank: [through voice box] Take your time, Rainbow Dash.
Rainbow Dash: Taking time is what got me into this mess!
Tank: [through voice box] You must learn the way of the slowpoke. Not every problem is settled through speed alone. Sometimes you must stop, focus, and sit still.
Rainbow Dash: [groans] No time!
Tank: [through voice box] Stop... focus... be still.
Rainbow Dash: You're right. I didn't take the time I needed to start with. I wound up rushing into this pickle. So, to get out of it... [deep breath] I need to stop... focus... be still.
Pinkie Pie: [panting] Rainbow Dash! Oh, thank hoofness I found you!
Rainbow Dash: Thank hoofness I found you! You ever thought about doing some silver accents in your mane?
Pinkie Pie: There's no time!
Rainbow Dash: Stop... focus... be still. [deep breath] Now let's throw a party! [gasps, screams]
[zip!]
Applejack: [deep breath, sighs] The Great Outdoors! Well, I'm pleased as apple pie to be leadin' the Trail Trotters troop on a camping trip. Time to dig our good old hooves into some good old dirt.
Rarity: [panting]
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, no. What's wrong, Rarity?
Rarity: Good grief. I've forgotten my equipment. [sighs]
Fluttershy: You can share with me.
Rarity: Oh, you're a peach, Flutter darling. But my equipment was for glamping. Camping in glitz, glamour, and comfort. Comfy mattress, a comfy bathtub, the comfy portable generator to plug in my comfy lamp – it's all very comfy!
Applejack: But not the most outdoors-y. No lamps are needed in... [deep breath, sighs] ...the Great Outdoors! Where it gets so dark, you can see all the stars in the night sky.
[wolf howls]
Pinkie Pie: Let's stop talking about it, and let's get camping! [panting]
Rainbow Dash: Do you have any idea where you're going, Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie: Hah! Hoo! Nope! Just got so excited, I couldn't wait any longer!
[zip!]
Rest of Mane Six: [laugh]
[Applejack]
I don't know, but I've been told
[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]
I don't know, but I've been told
[Applejack]
The campin' badge is made of gold
[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]
The camping badge is made of gold
[Applejack]
And over there I saw a mole
[Mane Six without Applejack and Rarity]
And over there I saw a mole
Rarity: Where?! [yelps]
Rest of Mane Six: Rarity?
Rarity: Aah!
[splash]
Rarity: [screams, yelping] I can't get out!
Fluttershy: Stay calm. The fear is in your head.
Rarity: But the water rushing around me is very real!
Applejack: Form a Trail Trotter chain!
Twilight Sparkle: [grunts]
Rainbow Dash: [grunts]
Pinkie Pie: [grunts]
Applejack: [grunts]
Rarity: [pants]
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash: [cheering and laughing]
Rarity: [coughing]
Twilight Sparkle: Are you okay?
Rarity: I'm wet but alive.
Rainbow Dash: Cannonball!
[splash!]
Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy: [laugh]
Pinkie Pie: Oh, Rainbow!
Fluttershy: Now we're all wet. Swim time!
Mane Six: [laughing]
Applejack: Huh. Here's a good spot to make camp.
Rarity: Oh, wonderful news, darling. Let me know when that's all done. I shall be attending to my mane.
[frog croaks]
Fluttershy: We all have to help or we won't get the Camping Badge.
Applejack: You're right as rain, Fluttershy. Twilight, Pinkie, and Rainbow Dash, you three assemble the tents. Fluttershy and Rarity will help me build the fire.
Rarity: Me? Build? The fire?
Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie: Whoo-hoo! [groan]
Pinkie Pie: There's gotta be an easier way to do this. Master of Instructions?
Twilight Sparkle: I... I... I... I need to make a spreadsheet! Calculator!
[beeping]
Twilight Sparkle: [gasps] By my calculations, we need seven more ponies to get the job done!
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, I have a better idea.
[zooming]
Pinkie Pie: Whew! That was "in-tents" [intense]! Get it? In... tents?
Rarity: [whimpers] Oh! I haven't juggled since my vaudeville days. But I suppose I can try.
Applejack: Strike the rocks together. That'll create a spark.
Rarity: All right. [grunting]
Applejack: I feel like you're holdin' back. Give it your all!
Rarity: [grunts, sighs] Darlings, this is one pony who is not meant for camping.
Applejack: Now, that's just silly hogwash.
Rarity: Oh, I wish I had my glamping stuff. I wish I had my comfy mattress. I wish I had my lamp!
Rest of Mane Six: [groan]
Applejack: Now, now. Camping is about gettin' out of your comfort zone. And you're already doin' that.
Rarity: Am I?
Applejack: Yup. Just by comin' on this trip.
Rest of Mane Six: [agreeing]
Applejack: I know today was hard and maybe even scary, but I'm right proud of ya.
Fluttershy: Me, too.
Rarity: But I fell in the river.
Fluttershy: And got yourself out.
Rainbow Dash: You swam in the pond.
Twilight Sparkle: And you hiked into the woods.
Pinkie Pie: All without your glamping equipment.
Applejack: See? You're good at campin'. So, what do you say? Want to grab those rocks and light our campfire?
Rarity: [deep breath, grunting] Hah!
[flames roaring]
Rest of Mane Six: [cheer]
[pop!]
Rarity: Perhaps I was born to play the part of a camper after all.
Pinkie Pie: And I'm ready to get close up to some camping treats!
[thud]
Pinkie Pie: Mm-mm!
Mane Six: [indistinct chatter]
[horse whinnies]
Rarity: [deep breath, sighs] The Great Outdoors!
Pinkie Pie: [scatting]
[music winds down]
Pinkie Pie: [gasps]
[buzzing]
Pinkie Pie: Oh, no! Hmm...
[egg mixer whirring]
[blender whirring]
Pinkie Pie: [groans] Hmm...
[electric fizzling]
Pinkie Pie: [sighs] Hah!
[whirring builds]
Pinkie Pie: Huh?
[electric fizzling]
Pinkie Pie: Oooh, pretty. Wait. This can't be good.
Fluttershy: [singsong] Tablet time... I love my tablet time...
[winding down]
Rarity: [wailing] My eyes! I can't see!
Rainbow Dash: [whimpering] Gonna be honest! I don't love the dark!
[light switch clicking]
Applejack: Okay, hang on. Hang on, y'all. Let's keep it together long enough to find out what happened. We're gonna need a little artificial sunshine.
[clatter]
Pinkie Pie: Mmm, anypony else happen to... plug in a device and get purple sparks?
Rest of Mane Six: No.
Rainbow Dash: Uh, no purple sparks around here.
Pinkie Pie: Cool, cool. Cool, cool. Yeah, uh-huh. Definitely not from me either. [laughs nervously] Good to know.
Fluttershy: Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Oh. The electrician won't be here for at least an hour.
Rest of Mane Six: [groans]
Twilight Sparkle: Well, hang on, everypony. We could stand around getting mad that the power's off. We could sit around wishing on potion magic that we were electricians. Or we could pass the time by... telling stories!
Rarity: I guess that could be...
Fluttershy: ...kind of fun!
Fluttershy: I got one! I got a real good one! Remember the time we baked a twenty-seven-layer cupcake?
Twilight Sparkle: Oh, yes!
Fluttershy: [narrating] It was a normal day. Everypony was baking together and having fun.
Mane Six: [laughing]
Rarity: More layers! We need more layers! [panting]
Twilight Sparkle: No way. It's the perfect size.
Fluttershy: [narrating] But soon, our perfect cupcake would devolve into perfect chaos!
Pinkie Pie: Aah!
[rattling]
Cupcake Monster: [roars]
Mane Six: [scream]
Rainbow Dash: Wait, wait, wait! You're making it sound like a kitchen nightmare! It wasn't scary. Here's how it really happened.
Rainbow Dash: [panting] Jam, ponies! Discord's making his famous lava brownies, and we cannot be shown up!
[whooshing]
Twilight Sparkle: Excuse me! That is ridiculous! There are inaccuracies all over these stories.
Pinkie Pie: Okay, then how did it happen?
Twilight Sparkle: It was a lovely sunny day.
Twilight Sparkle: [narrating] We were baking in the kitchen. I combined four eggs, two cups of milk, a cup of flour, a pinch of magic, exactly one bag of sugar—
Rarity: [sighs] I am on the verge of fainting... at your level of detail! That wasn't a story at all. It was a very accurate cupcake recipe.
Twilight Sparkle: Well, excuuuuuuse me for being meticulous! Why don't you regale us with your story?
Rarity: Ah, with pleasure and gusto. It was a day not unlike today. Jazz was all the rage.
Rarity: [narrating] I had to be at Jay's mansion on East Egg in two hours. Little did I know, his old flame Daffodil lived across the way. Anywho, I had no idea where my prized diamond necklace was. Not the really good one, mind you. The really really good one. Ugh! And I was retracing all of my steps, starting in the forest. "Where is my necklace? Where—?"
Pinkie Pie: RARITY! That's not the story we're telling.
Rarity: Well, it's the story I'm telling.
Pinkie Pie: Well, we're telling the tale of the twenty-seven-layer cupcake.
Applejack: Now that I think about it, wasn't it thirty layers?
Twilight Sparkle: Am I drinking crazy potion, or was it twenty-seven one-layer cupcakes?
Fluttershy: It was very specifically one huge twenty-seven-layer cupcake!
Rainbow Dash: Did we win an award? I think we won for fastest baker.
Rest of Mane Six: [groan]
Pinkie Pie: There's no such award!
Mane Six: [indistinct arguing]
[boom!]
[whirring]
Pinkie Pie: Uh-oh.
[splatting]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Rainbow Dash: Quick! Unplug the mixing bowl!
[ding!]
[electric fizzle]
[whoosh]
[beep]
Mane Six: Whew! [laugh]
Pinkie Pie: I wonder how we're all gonna remember this.
Fluttershy: As long as we remember we're together as friends, it's a memory we're gonna share forever.
Twilight Sparkle: I'm also writing all of this down for accuracy. "It was the best of times... it was the best of times!"
Mane Six: [laughing]
Pinkie Pie: Get 'em while they're hot and tasty! New glittery treats featuring cosmic cotton candy crystals! Straight from the oven and...
Rest of Mane Six: [laughing]
[whoosh!]
Pinkie Pie: ...into your mouth. [chomps]
[giggling]
Pinkie Pie: [giggling]
Rarity: I dare say, dear girl, these cupcakes are so good, I think I need to lie down. [chomps]
[poof!]
Rarity: [sighs]
Rest of Mane Six: [laugh]
Pinkie Pie: I'm gonna spend the whole day baking new treats. And you'll be my taste-testing team.
Rest of Mane Six: [gasp]
Pinkie Pie: There's literally nothing that can come between me and my baking!
[squirt]
Mane Six: [gasp]
[zip!]
Applejack: I reckon you spoke too soon, Pinkie. Somethin's out there blockin' the sun.
[sci-fi music]
Pinkie Pie: [gasps] Maybe it's another cosmic event!
Mane Six: Uh...
Fluttershy: I have no idea what in Equestria it could be. It's a mysterious mane-scratcher.
[deep humming]
[zip!]
Fluttershy: [whimpers]
Pinkie Pie: It looks like something's inside. Are any of you... scared?
Rest of Mane Six: [whimpering]
Rarity: Yes! Here we go again...
[poof!]
[squirrel chittering]
Rainbow Dash: S-Should we... follow that squirrel?
Applejack: Why would we do that?
Rainbow Dash: I-I don't know! I panicked!
Twilight Sparkle: We should wait and see what happens. And in the meantime, we can study this giant balloon... airship?
Pinkie Pie: I don't know if it's my nerves or the phrase "giant balloon airship", but every time I think about what's inside that thingy, my thoughts go from sweet to sour. Is anypony else's imagination running wild?
Rest of Mane Six: ["Mm-hmm", "Uh-huh", etc.]
Applejack: Yup. And... start fantasy sequence montage.
Pinkie Pie: There could be more rare baking ingredients inside! [giggling]
[squirt!]
Rest of Mane Six: [scream]
Pinkie Pie: Stuff me full of cookies, that's chocolate lava! [laughs] The scorching s'mores I could make! Huh? That's a lot of chocolate lava! Coming right for me! Rarity, what do you think it could be?
Rarity: Maybe the balloon will transform into a stage! Ponies will gather from far and wide to watch me perform my one-pony show Lamilton! I play a little lamb who transforms the world through song and i-lamb-ic pentameter!
[singing]
I wanna be in the loom where wool happens
The loom where wool—
[crowd booing]
[tomatoes splatting]
Rarity: [grunting] Didn't expect a pelting! Get it? A "pelt"-ing? [laughs]
[splat!]
Rarity: Okay. I'll see myself out.
Twilight Sparkle: Or the balloon could be a giant library containing all the information in the universe! What I would give to be inside with all those books!
[rumbling]
[ka-chunk!]
Twilight Sparkle: A reading light would be nice.
Rainbow Dash: Maybe it's a balloon monster! Maybe it's Balloonga the Destroyer!
Balloonga: Behold! I am Balloonga! All ponies bow before— Wait. "Balloonga"? My name's "Balloonga"?
Rainbow Dash: Uh, I'm not good with names.
Balloonga: But I am good with manes! [laughs evilly]
Rainbow Dash: [yells] Quick! Who's next?!
Applejack: Uh... maybe the balloon is full of apples?
Applejack: Hoo-wee! [laughs]
[squirt!]
Applejack: [whimpers] Even I know that's too many apples! [screams]
Pinkie Pie: Hm. This fantasy feels familiar.
Applejack: End montage! End montage!
[poof!]
Fluttershy: Maybe all those will happen. Or none of them. Honestly, I'm okay with waiting to find out.
Rest of Mane Six: Huh?
Pinkie Pie: You're not scared? It could be any of those things! That's... well, it's... it's scary!
Fluttershy: Am I curious about the giant, mysterious, hovering, glowing airship balloon that none of us have any idea what it could be or what will happen next because of it being here all of a sudden?
Rest of Mane Six: ["Yes!"/"Exactly!", whimpering]
Fluttershy: But that doesn't mean we should jump to the worst-case scenario. Everypony take a deep breath.
Mane Six: [inhale, exhale]
Fluttershy: Repeat after me. The unknown is not scary.
Rest of Mane Six: The unknown is not...
Mane Six: [yelp]
Rarity: [faints]
Twilight Sparkle: By my calculations, I think this balloon – I mean, these balloons – are somehow related to the cosmic event of the Cotton Candy Comet!
Pinkie Pie: Hmm. What makes you say that, Twi?
[deep humming]
Mane Six: [gasp]
Rainbow Dash: Yup. Story checks out. Pinkie, you look nervous.
Pinkie Pie: I feel it!
Fluttershy: The unknown is not scary.
Pinkie Pie: The unknown is not scary!
Fluttershy: In a way, it's actually kind of exciting 'cause we'll figure it out together. Right?
Rest of Mane Six: ["Yup"/"Mm-hmm", whimper]
[ominous music]
Applejack: [chuckles] Cliffhanger.
